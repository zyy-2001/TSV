## Requirements

```bash
conda env create -f tsv.yml
```
---

## LLM response generation

Generate responses for each question to construct an unlabeled QA dataset in the wild.

```bash
bash gen.sh
```

---

## GT generation

Generate [BLEURT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04696) score for each QA pair


```bash
bash gt.sh
```

---

## Train TSV

Train TSV for hallucination detection.

### Observation 1
```bash
bash observation1.sh
```

### Observation 2
```bash
bash observation2.sh
```

### Observation 3 w/ router
```bash
bash observation3_1.sh
```

### Observation 3 w/o router
```bash
